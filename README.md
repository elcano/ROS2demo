# ROS2demo
Demonstration of Cooperative Connected Automated Vehicles (CCAV) based on ROS2

Initial stages will be done in simulation. Plan is to migrate the system to 1/10 automated vehicles and then to full sized-vehicles.
The system shall show vehicles forming and leaving platoons driving bumper-to-bumper. Vehicles will be equiped with a mechanism that lets them physically connect.

The ultimate objective is described in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356194082_Improved_Bus_Service_on_Ten_Times_Less_Energy

Animations of the concept are  the smart connecting car video on:
